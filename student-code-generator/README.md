## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

I have created a program that takes in values for student marks and generates the required grades as per the requirements. i.e..

"Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows:

A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40."

I used HTML as the basic website generator, styled it with CSS and added the Grade generator using JavaScript.
